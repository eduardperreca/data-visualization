# data-visualization
this repo aims to visualize the trend of the Italian parliamentary elections starting from the 1940s up to 2022, touching and analyzing different trends such as:

- Average attendance at polling stations for political elections, commenting on the various reasons

- Average attendance at polling stations for the various referendums, analyzing the degree of belonging of each citizen to the shared question.

- Sentimental analysis using ```py python``` by analyzing tweets from top politicians targeted during political campaigns and how they impacted political outcomes, and what sentiments they conveyed through what they shared.

- Sentimental analysis of a small questionnaire made to a precise niche of people (voters and non-voters), on a very specific question:
Do you feel represented by current politics?

everything was plotted using ```matplotlib``` and ```plotly```
